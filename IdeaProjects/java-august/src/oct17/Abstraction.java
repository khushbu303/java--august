public class Abstraction {

    // abstraction: it is shwing only essential feature of the object to the user and hidhing the inner details

    // t\two way to achieve abstraction : 1. abstract class: any class which is declared with abstract keyword, we can not achieve 100% abstract

    //  ==> class has abstract mthd it should be abstract
    // ==>
    // 2: interfaces: it can be thought as a contract that a class has to fulfill while implementing interface
    // it is a public and abstract method ,
// interface does not have body <= only apply on JAVA7
// interview que:  marker interface: does not have methods or nothing
